# Introduction

MESG is an open-source decentralized network of reusable bridges to technologies. It allows users to connect any businesses or services together, including any blockchains, regardless of their programming language. 

Through an event-driven microservice infrastructure, each connected service within MESG exists independently, yet is fully compatible with all other connected services. This cooperative independence and the ability to share and reuse existing connections allows development costs to be reduced by up to 98%. 

Once a connection to a service has been built, it can be shared in the Network, allowing developers or companies to generate passive income each time their connection is used by other MESG users.

Take the best of what has already been built to create your custom solution for a fraction of the cost. 

You can get involved by writing code or combining already-existing bridges into viable solutions. All contributors benefit from an incentive system designed to reward participation.

Weâ€™re excited to see what you come up with.
