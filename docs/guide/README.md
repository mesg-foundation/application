# Introduction

MESG is an open-source decentralized infrastructure which makes all technologies interoperable, including blockchains. In short, it’s a building platform for developers.

Instead of individually connecting each technology to your application, you can now make a single connection to [Core](start-here/core.md) and allow Core to manage connections to all other technologies on your application's behalf. It handles the communication of information and tasks between any technologies and your application, making the creation and maintenance of DApps a breeze.  

This technology-agnostic architecture allows all technologies and languages to play nicely together for the first time in a decentralized way, ushering in a new era of productivity and possibilities.

**Arriving Q3 2018:**

Once a connection from a technology to Core is made, it can be shared in a Marketplace, allowing developers to generate income each time their connection is used.

Take the best of what has already been created to build your custom solution. This building platform allows you to easily connect technologies without needing to code or know the languages of the technologies you're using.

You can get involved by writing code or creating viable solutions, all while benefiting from an incentive system designed to reward building.

We’re excited to see what you come up with.
