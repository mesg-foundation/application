# Deploy a service

Once you finish developing your service and testing it, you can deploy it. A unique ID will be generated when you deploy a service. This ID is based on the [`mesg.yml`](service-file.md) file and will change every time you add any modifications to this service.

To deploy the service you can run the command:

```bash
mesg-core service deploy PATH_OF_THE_SERVICE
```

This will generate an ID that looks similar to `v1_fe25be776e1e256400c77067a1cb7666`. You can reuse this ID when you want to use the service.

### List deployed services

If you want to see the list of services already deployed you can run the command:

```bash
mesg-core service list
```

### Delete a deployed service

If for any reason you want to delete a service that you previously deployed you can do it using the command:

```bash
mesg-core service delete SERVICE_ID
```
