# What is a Service?

A Service is a normalized bi-directional communication layer which acts a connection from any technology to Core.

MESG depends heavily on Services. These Services are automatically built and ran inside Docker. You can connect anything you want, as long as it can run inside Docker \(as long as it can run on a computer\). If you need more details about how to connect dependencies to your service check out the [Dockerize the Service](dockerize-the-service.md) page.

A service needs to implement two types of communications: receiving tasks and submitting events. 

## Receiving Tasks

Tasks are designed to receive information from Core and the Application that you run. Tasks can have multiple parameters as inputs and multiple outputs with varying data. You can visualize a task as a simple function that can return any kind of object.

You could have a task that takes a name as an input, and perhaps shows `success` as an output. This task factors the type of name with its probability like this:`{ "type": "female", "proabiliy": 92.34% }` but, could also have an `error` output with a type of error like this: `{ "message": "This doesn't looks like a name" }`.

## Submitting Events

Events are data that a Service emits in real time.   
  
Let's say you are working with a webserver. An event could be when there is a request with data in the payload, or it could be different events for each of the different routes of your API, or could be in a blockchain context when a smart contract emits an event.

For more info on how to create events, learn more on our [Emit an Event](emit-an-event.md) page.

## Share Services 

New Services can be created and shared. Alternatively, builders can use already-created services without coding by using our [Awesome](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/awesome) repository.   
  
**In Q3 2018**, once the Network is deployed, Services will be shared or sold on our Marketplace, opening up an economy of efficiencies and solutions.
