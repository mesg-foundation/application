# Core

MESG Core is an application that manages all communications with all technologies.

Rather than your application needing to connect to many technologies' APIs, your application needs to connect to only one: Core's API, to connect to any other technology, on or off the blockchain.

Core is not the foundation of your application, but rather an external communication manager for your application, providing infinite compatibility.

In the current stage of MESG deployment, Core is simply your centralized application's external communications manager, allowing it to be interoperable with any other technology on the internet.

Once our Network is deployed, Core will take an alternative role as the receiver of a list of tasks, and will utilize the power of the decentralized Network for the hosting of your app and the processing and execution of tasks.

The network will be deployed **in Q3 of 2018.** At that time, users will be able to share or sell connections to technologies in our Marketplace, making assembly easy. Until then, users can utilize [GitHub's repositories](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/) or other resources to share connections.   
  
Until Q3 2018, applications will be temporarily centralized on the user's machine until the decentralized network is ready for deployment.
