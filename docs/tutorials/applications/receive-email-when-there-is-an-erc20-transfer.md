# Receive email when there is an ERC20 transfer

Today we'll learn how to create a JavaScript application that connects two MESG Services:

* [Service Ethereum ERC20](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/service-ethereum-erc20)
* [Service Email SendGrid](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/service-email-sendgrid)

Those two services have tutorial on how to create them. Check them out:

* [Tutorial: Transfer notifications from an ERC20 transfer](https://tutorials.mesg.com/services/listen-to-transfer-of-ethereum-erc20-token)
* [Tutorial: Sending emails through SendGrid](https://tutorials.mesg.com/services/send-email-with-sendgrid)

You can access the final version of the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/tutorials/tree/master/applications/email-notification-one-erc20-transfer).

{% hint style="info" %}
MESG Core should already be installed on your computer. If it isn't yet, [install it here](https://docs.mesg.com/start-here/installation).
{% endhint %}

## Setup

### Start core

Let's start MESG Core, if it isn't already running:

```text
mesg-core start
```

### Deploy the Services

We'll start with our two already-created services. If you haven't already, make sure to read the tutorials to see how they were created.

#### Deploy the ERC20 Service

```bash
mesg-core service deploy https://github.com/mesg-foundation/service-ethereum-erc20
```

Make sure to copy/paste the service ID somewhere. You will need it later.

Note: By default, this service is listening for a TRON ERC20 transfer, but it can be changed by following the [service documentation](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/service-ethereum-erc20).

#### Deploy the SendGrid Service

This will be the same process as the ERC20:

```bash
mesg-core service deploy https://github.com/mesg-foundation/service-email-sendgrid
```

Make sure to copy/paste the service ID somewhere. You will need it later.

### Get a SendGrid API Key

Go to [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api\_keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) then click on "Create API Key". Select "Full Access" and follow the steps. Copy/paste the generated API Key somewhere. You will need it later.

### Init the application

Let's init the application:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then, install `mesg-js` library:

```bash
npm install --save mesg-js
```

## Code the application

The setup for our application has finished. Now, let's code it. Create and open a `index.js` file.

### Listen for Transfer events

Let's define a variable for the event we want to listen to:

```javascript
// Event we need to listen
const erc20Transfer = {
  serviceID: __ERC20_SERVICE_ID__, // The serviceID of the ERC20 service deployed
  filter: 'transfer' // The event we want to listen
}
```

Replace `__ERC20_SERVICE_ID__` with the right values. You can deploy the ERC20 service again if you didn't copy its service ID.

### Execute the send email task

Let's define another variable for the task we want to execute:

```javascript
// Task to execute
const sendEmail = {
  serviceID: __SENDGRID_SERVICE_ID__, // The serviceID of the service to send emails
  taskKey: 'send', // The task we want to execute
  inputs: (eventKey, { from, to, value, transactionHash }) => { // a function that returns the inputs for the send task based on the data of the event
    console.log('new transfer received with hash', transactionHash)
    return {
      apiKey: __SENDGRID_API_KEY__,
      from: 'test@erc20notification.com',
      to: __REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL__,
      subject: 'New transfer on TRON',
      text: `Transfer from ${from} to ${to} with the amount ${value} -> ${transactionHash}`
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `__SENDGRID_SERVICE_ID__`, `__SENDGRID_API_KEY__` and `__REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL__` by the right values. You can deploy the SendGrid service again if you didn't copy its service ID.

#### Link the event to the task

Great, now we need to link this event and task together using MESG.

Require the `mesg-js` library on top of your code with the following code:

```javascript
const MESG = require('mesg-js').application()
```

Then simply add the `whenEvent` function at the end of your code to link the event to the task:

```javascript
MESG.whenEvent(erc20Transfer, sendEmail)
```

#### Run it!

Now your application is ready.

```bash
node index.js
```

Your application will automatically start the services, connect to the Ethereum network, and send you an email every time a transfer occurs on the TRON ERC20 token.

**Note**

Be patient, as it's based on real transfers on the TRON ERC20 token, you might have to wait a few minutes before any transfer occurs. You can see the activity of the TRON token on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf230b790e05390fc8295f4d3f60332c93bed42e2).

Be careful, the TRON token could see a surge of activity so it is possible to have thousands of emails per day and reach the SendGrid limit if you leave your application running.
